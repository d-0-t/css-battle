# CSSBattle
In this repo you can find my solutions for [CSSBattle](https://cssbattle.dev/) targets. :)

Each "battle" will be in its own folder, containing separate files for each target.

You can see my profile [[here]](https://cssbattle.dev/player/d0t), but the site only shows the overall score & rank. Keep in mind, I'm not removing the spacings from the code, nor am I using weird inline-style hacks that will make the code unreadable, so I obviously score less / rank worse. I'm not competitive enough to do any of this, and I prefer to be able to look at my code and actually understand what I was doing when I solved the task.
